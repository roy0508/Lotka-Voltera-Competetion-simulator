# Lotka-Voltera-Competetion-simulator
The Lotka-Volterra competition model is a classic mathematical framework used to describe the dynamics of biological populations in competitive ecological settings. This simulation aims to illustrate how two species interact over time, influenced by growth rates and carrying capacities.

Model Dynamics:
Equations: The model consists of two coupled differential equations representing the population dynamics of two species, denoted as Species 1 (N1) and Species 2 (N2). These equations incorporate parameters such as growth rates (r1, r2), carrying capacities (K1, K2), and interaction coefficients (α, β).

Species Interactions: Species interact competitively based on their population sizes relative to their respective carrying capacities and the impact of the other species on their growth rates.

Predictions: The model predicts the long-term outcomes of competition:

Winner Prediction: Based on the equilibrium points derived from the model, it predicts which species will dominate the competition or if stable coexistence is expected.
Simulation Details:
Input Parameters: Users input initial population sizes, growth rates, carrying capacities, and the duration of the simulation.

Simulation Execution: The differential equations are numerically integrated using the scipy.integrate.odeint function to simulate population changes over time.

Parameter Estimation: The simulation estimates model parameters (α, β) by fitting the simulated data to the Lotka-Volterra equations, providing insights into the competitive dynamics.

Visualization: Results are visualized through plots within a Tkinter-based graphical user interface (GUI). The plot shows the simulated population dynamics of both species over time, alongside fitted model predictions.

Application:
Ecological Insights: Used in ecology to understand how species compete for resources and how their populations can stabilize or fluctuate over time.

Educational Tool: Demonstrates principles of population ecology, differential equations, and numerical modeling in biological sciences.

Research and Analysis: Provides a platform for testing hypotheses about species interactions and predicting the outcomes of ecological scenarios under different parameter conditions.

This simulation model not only illustrates the foundational principles of ecological competition but also serves as a practical tool for exploring population dynamics and competitive interactions in various ecological contexts. Adjustments in model parameters and inputs allow for a range of simulations, making it versatile for different ecological studies and educational purposes.
